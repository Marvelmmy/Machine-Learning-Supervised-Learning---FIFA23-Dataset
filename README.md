## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a cleaned version of FIFA 23 player data, including attributes such as:

- Player positions
- Pace, Shooting, Passing, Dribbling, Defending, and Physical stats
- Club, Nation, Age, and more

## 🧠 Supervised Learning Algorithms Applied

This project applies several ML models to predict target variables (e.g., overall rating, player value, or classification tasks like position group):

### ✅ Models Used:
**Random Forest**

---

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

Each model is evaluated based on:

- **Accuracy**
- **Precision / Recall / F1-score**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** (for regression)
- **Confusion Matrix**
- **Classification Reports**
- **Cross-Validation Scores**
